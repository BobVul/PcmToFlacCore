    /// its own dedicated thread when running the operation asynchronously. When running on
    /// its own thread, the action is executed in a tight loop until all pending operations
    /// have been completed. This type of synchronized operation should be preferred if
    /// operations may take a long time, block the thread, or put it to sleep. It is also
    /// recommended to prefer this type of operation if the speed of the operation is not
    /// critical or if completion of the operation is critical, such as when saving data
    /// to a file.
